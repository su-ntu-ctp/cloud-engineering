Self-Study: High Availability and Disaster Recovery
Brief
High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) are essential strategies for ensuring service continuity during failures, outages, or disasters. This self-study will provide an in-depth understanding of HA and DR concepts, RAID levels, cloud-based solutions, and best practices for designing resilient systems.
